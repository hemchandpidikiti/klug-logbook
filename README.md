*UBUNTU*

SQL acts a databse fro to record all the tasks and store the data 

before installing update the packages and start setuping the database

     sudo apt update

     sudo apt install mysql-server -y

Doing so will open a prompt in your terminal for package configuration. Use the down arrow to select the **Ok** option.

Press **Enter**. This should prompt you to enter a **password:**. Your are basically setting the root password for MySQL. Don‚Äôt confuse it with root password of Ubuntu system.

Type in a password and press Tab to select **<Ok>**. Press **Enter**. You‚Äôll now have to re-enter the password. After doing so, press Tab again to select **<Ok>**. Press **Enter**.

Some information on configuring MySQL Server will be presented. Press Tab to select **<Ok>** and **Enter** again:

noe check the sql is properly installed by the bellow command

     sudo systemctl status mysql.service

You should see Active: **active (running)** in there somewhere. If you don‚Äôt, use the following command to start the service:

create user and grant all permissions to it 

     create user 'user_name'@'localhost' identified by 'password';

     grant all privileges  on * . * to 'user_name'@'localhost';

     flush privileges; 

to login to ur personal sql user user this bellow command

     mysql -h user_name -u user -p


- *h* is used to specify a host name (if the server is located on another machine; if it isn‚Äôt, just omit it)
- *u* mentions the user
- *p* specifies that you want to input a password.

`fore reference mysql -u chinnu -p1234`
